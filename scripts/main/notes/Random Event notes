Sergeant Damien:
    npc ids:
        npc id: 337

    object ids:
        push ups: "Exercise mat", 16508
        star jumps: "Exercise mat", 20810
        jogging: "Exercise mat", 9313
        sit-ups: "Exercise mat", 20801

        WRONG!! Need to obtain since we cant see id ingame:

        try fetch and print the object:
            for (RS2Object sign : objects.getAll()) {
                String name = sign.getName(); // should be like "Bow", "Dance", etc.
                Position matTile = sign.getPosition().translate(0, -1, 0); // adjust depending on orientation
                RS2Object mat = objects.closest(o -> o.getPosition().equals(matTile) && isMat(o));

                if (mat != null) {
                    log("Found object! Name: " + name + ", mat: " + mat);
                    emoteToMat.put(name, mat);
                }
            }


    widgets:
        chatbox widget: (231, 0)
        click to continue dialogue widget: (231, 5)
        "I want to see you on that mat doing star jumps, private!": (231, 6)
        Seargeants char within (231, 0) widget = (231, 1) Note: this might be the one we read to determine what to do
