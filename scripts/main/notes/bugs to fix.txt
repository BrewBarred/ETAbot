(iF2P) Air/Earth/Essence..
    - Successfully withdraws the selected pickaxe but fails to equip it
        - should check players attack level and compare against pickaxe requirement somehow, either items cache or maybe osbot api has a function for this

Iron banker:
    - Always banks if started in bank (even if items required already obtained), just opens and closes for no reason
    - If you pause the script it will stop it, then you won't be able to resume again
    - Bot hops too fast - sometimes players login to check spot then logout, and bot will hop worlds for no reason

Tests:
    - Task class (complete test)
    - Fetch class (complete test)
    - Digging at invalid tiles
    - Check if it's possible to add logic to pauseMenu() to check the bots safety before pausing?
    -
      TEST if pauseMenu() can be used to safe your bot from danger before pausing script
      TEST getTaskList() function, should return a list of tasks in the queue
      TEST check menu visibility
      TEST open and close bot menu
      TEST open and close bot menu
